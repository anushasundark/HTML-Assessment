# HTML-Assessment

HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the fundamental language used in web development to structure and present content on the internet. It consists of a series of elements, each represented by tags, that define the structure and semantics of a web page. Elements can range from headings ('<h1>' to '<h6>') and paragraphs ('<p>') to images ('<img>') and links ('<a>'). HTML documents typically have a standard structure with a <head> section containing metadata like title and styles, and a <body> section where the main content resides. Attributes within tags provide additional information or functionality. HTML plays a pivotal role in creating the backbone of web pages, allowing for the integration of multimedia, forms, and dynamic content. Understanding HTML is foundational for anyone venturing into web development, as it serves as the backbone for building interactive and visually appealing websites.
